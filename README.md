Making the model - Trust worthy


## Abstract

Making system trustable and believable is one of the important goals of data science. Models are mostly black boxes, where we know little what is happening in the model. This plays a vital role in making people trust the model. In the places where data model decision is very important like medical field or self-driving car or other critical places, the confidence in the model plays the key role which depends on the understanding of the model being built and used.

Focus is to build a system that can be used to transform the unassured model into assured and dependable one. This can be done by different methods in this project we will make use of the model interpretability, causal inference and debiasing to make the model trustworthy.

First, the Model interpretability will be helping to understand black-box layers of the model and to make better intuition of the model. Second, causal inference will be defining the underlying reason for correlation and causation and possible wrong interpretation. At last, learning about bias in the model and applying the debiasing method and make sure the model output is debiased.
