Making the model - Trust worthy


## Abstract

Making a machine trustworthy and reliable is one of the most important goals of data science today. Models are many times used as black boxes, wherein we give a particular input, know little of what happens inside the model, and get an output. But an important question that often gets overlooked is 'Why?' In some cases, one might not care why a decision was made, it is enough to know that the predictive performance on a test dataset was good. But in other cases, knowing the ‘Why’ can help learn more about the problem, the data and the reason why a model might fail. In cases such as cancer detection, self-driving cars or other critical places that can involve life and death, this becomes extremely crucial. 

In this project, Abhishek Gargha Maheshwarappa and Kartik Kumar aim to build a system that can be used to transform an unassured model into an assured and dependable one. This will be done using established methods and basic concepts of machine learning interpretability.
